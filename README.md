# circular_buffer
Just a simple circular buffer

It's a study case to force myself to use TDD and always a work in progress.

## Circular buffer with fixed lenght
	-	Fixed lenght
	-	Elements using uint8_t
	- 	Unit tests with tinytest
	-	Simple but useful

## TODO
[ ] - Variable lenght (Now it's fixed to 5 elements);
[ ] - Add more tests;
[ ] - Change buffer to user declared buffer;
[ ] - Change buffer from uint8_t to void* (then you can use this to any struct);
[ ] - Documentation doxygen;
[ ] - Documentation sphynx;


Thanks, Jefferson.
